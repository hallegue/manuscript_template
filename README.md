This is a minimal example of a scientific manuscript template using [**RMarkdown**](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

It is possible to export the manuscript in `pdf` or `word` (see files in `/_book/`). However, the word version has some bugs, e.g., in numbering figures and tables in supplementary materials. Personally, I only use the word version for coauthor reviewing and the pdf version for official journal submissions. 

I use [`TinyTex`](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) as LaTex distribution. 

Here some useful online tutorials that helped me to produce this template:
